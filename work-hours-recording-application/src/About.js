            <p>This application allows to make hours recordings for different tasks. When application is launched (using "npm start", user can see main page with three different links. First link - "Record hours" - allows to make recordings of tasks and time for that tasks. Second link - "See all recordings" - shows all recordings were made during whole time of using app. Third link - "About" - shows this page.</p>
            <p>Approximately 70 hours were spend on this application.</p>
            <p>Most difficult for me was time tracking feature.</p>
